# Introduction

Welcome to the Student Exam Performances project website. This project analyzes the performance of students in exams using the Kaggle dataset. It focuses on understanding factors such as demographics, parental education levels, and test preparation, and how these correlate with exam scores.

## Exploring Exam Scores

### Distribution of Math Scores

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Load dataset
students <- read.csv("data/StudentsPerformance.csv")

# Plot distribution of math scores
ggplot(students, aes(x = `math score`, fill = gender)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Math Scores by Gender", x = "Math Score", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
    legend.title = element_blank(),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 12)
  )
