# Data Sources and Cleaning

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle's "Students Performance in Exams" dataset. This dataset contains information about students' demographics, parental education levels, lunch type, test preparation status, and exam scores in math, reading, and writing.

## Data Cleaning

Before conducting the analysis, the dataset underwent several cleaning steps:

- **Handling Missing Values**: Checked for missing values in all columns. For columns with missing data (e.g., parental education level), decisions were made based on the impact of missing values on the analysis. Missing values were either imputed or removed, depending on the context.
  
- **Data Transformation**: Converted categorical variables (e.g., gender, race/ethnicity) into factors for easier analysis and visualization.
  
- **Outlier Detection**: Identified potential outliers in exam scores using statistical methods (e.g., Tukey's fences). Outliers were carefully examined and either removed or kept based on their impact on the overall analysis.

## Observations Removed

- **None**: The dataset did not require the removal of entire observations. However, outliers in exam scores were removed to ensure the robustness of the analysis and visualizations.
