## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize the data to uncover patterns and insights into student performance. The following sections cover:

- **Home**: Introduction to the website and what its about with examples and visuals.
- **Data Analysis**: Methods used to analyze the data with visuals.
- **Sources**: The origin of the data and its contents.
- **About**: About the project and the author.
