# Data Analysis of Student Exam Performances

## Introduction

Provide an introduction to the dataset and its context. Mention the source (Kaggle dataset on student exam performances), the variables included, and any initial insights or hypotheses you want to explore.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Overview of the Dataset

Describe the dataset structure, including the columns/features available and their meanings.

### Summary Statistics

Provide summary statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation for numerical variables like math scores, reading scores, and writing scores.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

# Load dataset
students <- read.csv("data/StudentsPerformance.csv")

# Calculate summary statistics
summary_stats <- students %>%
  summarise(
    mean_math_score = mean(`math score`, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_reading_score = mean(`reading score`, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_writing_score = mean(`writing score`, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_math_score = sd(`math score`, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_reading_score = sd(`reading score`, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_writing_score = sd(`writing score`, na.rm = TRUE)
)

# Print summary statistics
summary_stats
students %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_math_score = mean(`math score`, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_reading_score = mean(`reading score`, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_writing_score = mean(`writing score`, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  gather(key = "subject", value = "mean_score", -gender) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = subject, y = mean_score, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Average Scores by Gender", x = "Subject", y = "Mean Score") +
  theme_minimal()
students %>%
  gather(key = "subject", value = "score", `math score`, `reading score`, `writing score`) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = `parental level of education`, y = score, fill = subject)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Scores by Parental Education Level", x = "Parental Education Level", y = "Score") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
